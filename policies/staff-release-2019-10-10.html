<h1 id="databrary-staff-release-form">Databrary Staff Release Form</h1>
<p>This form requests your release to share recordings of you collected during the performance of your research duties in a secure, web-based data library called Databrary (databrary.org). The library allows authorized researchers to access shared videos, and potentially to use carefully selected excerpts for scientific presentations and/or informational and educational purposes (based on the level of release given by participants). Authorized researchers will use professional judgment and uphold ethical principles in determining which excerpts and images to present and with which audiences.</p>

In giving my permission, I trust that authorized researchers will use their professional judgment and uphold ethical principles in determining which excerpts and images to present and with which audiences.</p>
