The following documents may be useful to researchers preparing ethics board or IRB applications, funding proposals, or in planning to share data with Databrary.

## Ethics review-related templates

## Databrary Access Agreement for laboratory staff

Laboratory staff and trainees cannot sign or initial the Databrary Access Agreement as is required for Authorized Investigators.
Still, Authorized Investigators who grant staff and trainees access to data shared by other researchers may want to require their affiliates to sign a document similar to the Databrary Access Agreement.
