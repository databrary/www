Title: Difference between volume and file level sharing settings
Brief: Difference
Order: 3800

There are two levels of sharing in Databrary: 1) volume level, and 2) file level.

All data on Databrary are stored in a volume, which you can think of as a folder that is organizing your study. That whole volume can either be **private** or **shared**.

If your volume is set to **private**, it doesn't matter what the individual file level permissions are, nobody can see your data. In fact, others will not even see that you have a volume created.

If your Databrary volume is set to **shared**, file level access depends on the [permission level](https://www.databrary.org/resources/guide/investigators/release/release-levels.html) you have set for each individual session folder. For data folders, this usually depends on participant permission - the level at which the participant consented to sharing. [Note: You can choose to be more restrictive than the participant permission level if, for example, the video includes something the participant might find embarrassing, or too private.] For materials folders (e.g., coding manuals, procedural videos, stimuli), you can set the permission level as high as you like; we encourage at least Authorized Users, so that others in the Databrary community can understand how you conducted your study and benefit from your expertise.

In other words, if your Databrary volume is set to **shared**, Databrary will allow access to everything you have uploaded and marked for sharing, based on the release level you have chosen. Also shared are all participant-level metadata: DOB, test-date, language, ethnicity, etc. However, please note that birthdate and test date will appear as XX-XX-YEAR for participants marked as Unreleased or Private.
