Title: Boilerplate Language for Funding Proposals
Brief: Proposals
Order: 3700

We have developed [boilerplate language ](|filename|../../policies/dmp-template.mdi) to help researchers who plan to store and share data in Databrary complete Data Management Plans or Resource Sharing Plans for proposals to NSF, NIH, or other funding agencies that require information about data sharing or dissemination plans.

Researchers should confirm funding agency, directorate, or program-specific resource sharing plans or data management plan requirements.
