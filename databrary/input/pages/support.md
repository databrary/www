Databrary is a home for scientists who use video in their research or teaching.

We encourage you to read [Databrary's Access Agreement](|filename|about/agreement.md) and its annexes, especially Annex III.
These documents provide extensive information about how Databrary is structured and how it should be used.
You may also get guidance about [working with a research ethics board or IRB](|filename|support/irb.md) or see how to incorporate data sharing using Databrary in a [Data Management Plan](|filename|support/grant.md) for a grant proposal.
Look up a term in the [glossary](|filename|support/definitions.mdi) if something doesn't make sense, or [contact us directly](|filename|support/contact-us.md) for one-on-one support.
