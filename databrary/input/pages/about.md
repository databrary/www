# Overview

Databrary is a restricted access repository specialized for storing, streaming, and sharing video and audio recordings collected as research data or documentation.
Databrary is based at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu).

Databrary has implemented a rigorous policy framework designed to permit the sharing and re-use of research data containing personally identifying information, with participant consent, in an ethical and efficient way. 
With a Databrary Access Agreement signed by their institution, researchers can re-use other scientists' data, improving reliability and transparency, and making data collection more cost effective. 
Researchers can also find illustrative video clips to use for teaching and conference presentations. 
Because Databrary provides persistent identifiers (DOIs) to shared datasets, researchers gain citation credit for their work. 
Databrary is unique in allowing authorized researchers to upload their own  research data and access multiple datasets containing personally identifying information shared by others.

# Datavyu

In addition to the Databrary library, we support [Datavyu](http://datavyu.org), a free, open source software tool for coding, exploring, and analyzing video data and other temporally dense data streams.
