# Overview

The Databrary Project aims to promote data sharing, archiving, and reuse among researchers who study human development. The project focuses on creating tools for scientists to store, manage, preserve, analyze and share video and related data. The project is based at [New York University](http://www.nyu.edu) and at [Penn State](http://www.psu.edu). The U.S. National Science Foundation (NSF) and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) have provided funding. [Read more...](https://www.databrary.org/about/about-databrary.html)

# Components

<p style="margin-bottom: 14px;">The Databrary Project has two main components:</p>

[Databrary](http://databrary.org)

:   A digital data library specialized for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video. Databrary also provides a set of tools that enable researchers to upload video and other materials as they are generated, thus reducing barriers to sharing.

[Datavyu](http://datavyu.org)

:   A free, open source software tool for coding, exploring, and analyzing video data and other temporally dense data streams.

# Share

<p style="margin-bottom: 14px;">When developmental scientists share research data (e.g., CHILDES, AddHealth, ECLS, Early Head Start), <a href="https://www.databrary.org/about/why-share.html">the field grows and prospers</a>. In addition, data sharing:</p>

- meets funder and journal requirements, 
- reflects our duty to participants and other scientists, 
- improves scientific practices by increasing transparency and reproducibility, and 
- expands our influence as researchers.
