Title: Sharing Data
Brief: Sharing Data
Order: 3500

Databrary offers many options for setting sharing levels and addressing to accommodate for the different needs of both researchers and participants.
Users may independently determine the level of sharing for an entire volume, sessions, and individual session-level files or .

Please familiarize yourself with the different levels so you can be sure that your data is presented and shared in the appropriate way.

# Volume-Level Sharing

By default, all studies are private when they are first created.
You can create studies and share data peer-to-peer with other users regardless of your authorization status, but you cannot share data openly until you are authorized.

To share an entire study, click on the "edit study" button at the top of the study page then navigate to the "access" tab on the bottom left and you will study sharing options.
Here you can also add collaborators to that volume.

The two options you will see are: 

- **Private**: Share only with collaborators selected below.

- **Shared**: Share with authorized researchers and selected information with the public.

If you keep the volume private, only you and and 'collaborators' that you add can view or access the data.
This is ideal if you are still collecting or coding data.
Databrary can be your workspace and you can choose to share the volume once you're ready.
If the volume is private, the following release levels will not be taken into account because all files will be private.


If you choose to share your volume, your sessions and files will be shared based on the release levels described below.


A collaborator is someone that has sufficient privileges to access all private data.
For example, this can be an individual from your lab or a co-author on a study.


You can then choose between three levels of access for collaborators:
 
- **Read-only**: For those you trust to view all data 

- **Read/write**: For those you trust to view, change, add, and remove data 

- **Investigator**: For fellow study investigators

Note that you can only grant collaborator-type access to the full dataset, including 'private' or unshared data.
You cannot grant access to only a section of a volume, for example just the Databrary-released data.
And collaborators will only have access to the specific volume they are added to.
The only way to grant an individual access to all of your volumes is to add them as an affiliate.

# Session-Level Release

Did the participant give you permission to share the data collected from his/her session?

By default, a session is indicated as private when it is first created.
You can indicate how the participant filled out the [Databrary Release Template](|filename|../../policies/release-template.mdi) on the spreadsheet.


When you want to create a new session on the spreadsheet, click "edit spreadsheet" on the study page and then click the cell "add session".
Please enter in the test date and then select the blank cell in the "release" column.
Use the drop down menu to identify what the participant will allow you to do with the session.
Look over the definitions of the [session release levels](|filename|release/release-levels.md).



# File-Level Classification

Does this file contain identifiable data? 

After you have added the metadata for a session on the spreadsheet, you can click the <img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/public/images/icon/session2.png"> to add files to your session.
Then click "Add a new file" and drop your desired file.
Under "Classification" you can use the checked boxes to indicate whether there is identifiable data in each specific file.
Files will default to the second classification level which states that the data contains identifiable data.
If your data does not match that level, check/uncheck the appropriate boxes until you reach the correct classification.


Classification Levels:

- **Never share this file**: only available to collaborators
- **This file contains identifiable data such as faces, voices, or dates**
- **Only share this file with authorized Databrary users for educational or research purposes**
- **This file may be available to anybody for unrestricted use**
