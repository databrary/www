Title: Getting Authorized
Brief: Getting Authorized
Order: 3100

To become an *authorized investigator* or *affiliate*, applicants must first [register](http://databrary.org/register) and read and agree to the [Databrary Access Agreement](|filename|../../policies/agreement.mdi).

To complete the authorization process, the applicant's agreement must be co-signed in one of the following ways:

- *Authorized investigators* must obtain approval from an authorized representative of their Institution (usually from the Grants and Contracts or the Sponsored Programs Office).
- *Affiliates* must obtain approval from the *authorized investigator* who oversees their research and who has already completed the authorization process.

There are different levels of access that *authorized investigator*s can grant [Affiliates](|filename|authorization/affiliates.md).
