## Reuse, publish, and spread the word!

Databrary and Datavyu provide valuable tools for increasing transparency and reproducibility in the developmental sciences. But to succeed, we need the Databrary community to help us increase both our profile in published works and the size of our video collection. So, please...

- **...reference Databrary and Datavyu**: If you used Databrary to share, store, or manage your own research data, shared excerpts illustrating your procedure or findings, used Datavyu to code your data, or if you reused an existing Databrary volume, please give us credit in the Methods section of your paper, or in a footnote, or endnote.  You will also receive more credit from journal reviewers, readers, and funders. Feel free to use our suggested text below, or to craft your own.

- **...credit the researcher**: Every volume is provided with a Databrary specific citation: please go to the volume page and use the citation listed under "How To Cite" to ensure that the contributor receives proper credit.
