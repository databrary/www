Title: Policies
Brief: Policies
Order: 2000

Databrary has developed an extensive policy framework for enabling sensitive and identifiable data to be shared.
The pillars of the framework are *restricted access* (embodied in the Databrary Access Agreement and its annexes) and *participant permission* to share (embodied in sharing release templates).

The following documents may be useful to all users:

- [Terms and Conditions of Use](|filename|policies/terms.mdi)

- [Privacy Policy](|filename|policies/privacy.mdi)

Researchers preparing funding proposals or who are considering using Databrary to share data may find these useful:

- [Data Security Best Practices](|filename|policies/best-practices.mdi)

- [Working with Your IRB](|filename|policies/work-with-irb.mdi)

- Participant [Bill of Rights](|filename|policies/bill-of-rights.mdi) regarding data sharing
