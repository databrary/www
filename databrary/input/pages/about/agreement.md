Title: Authorized access
Brief: Authorized access
Order: 1000

One of Databrary's distinguishing features is that it provides a proven framework for sharing sensitive and identifiable data within a trusted network of authorized researchers.

To achieve this, access to restricted materials on Databrary requires institutional authorization via the formal [Databrary Access Agreement](|filename|agreement/agreement.mdi) and its three annexes. 
[Annex I](|filename|agreement/agreement-annex-I.mdi) is a Statement of Rights and Responsibilities.
[Annex II](|filename|agreement/agreement-annex-II.mdi) can be used to add additional investigators to Databrary from an institution AFTER the initial full agreement has been completed by an investigator and the institution's Authorized Organizational Representative.
[Annex III](|filename|agreement/agreement-annex-III.mdi) is the Databrary Access Guide.
It describes some of the core Databrary policies and practices that are important for institutions and researchers to understand and abide by.
