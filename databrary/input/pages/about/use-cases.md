There are many ways to use Databrary. With it, researchers may:

## Preserve
- Upload video and metadata for sharing and archival storage so that the data will survive in usable form indefinitely.

## Inform
- Enhance teaching by extracting video clips that illustrate an empirical or theoretical point and which can be shown to students.
- Point readers and reviewers to excerpts (or, if authorized, to raw video data) that illustrate procedures and findings.

## Draw inspiration
- View archived data for exemplars.
- Reinforce the principles open scientific inquiry by verifying coding procedures, evaluating displays or apparatus, and assessing how a published study's conclusions were drawn.
- Browse the database to stimulate ideas that lead to further research.

## Conduct New Research
- Expand sample sizes, run replication studies, examine cohort effects, and assess possible differences due to geographical location or population by using suitable data in the archive.
- Integrate video across archived studies to create new datasets or to conduct meta-analyses on raw data or metadata.
- Build on other researchers' codes to extend or transform prior analyses, promote further discovery, and return the results Databrary.
- Score archived video for behaviors that were outside the scope of the original study and then return the results to Databrary.
- Use archived video for new purposes in fields outside developmental psychology.

## Build and Test Tools
- Use archived data to test the performance of visualization, exploration, and analysis tools.
- Use various tools contributed to the archive to enhance understanding of their own data.

## Collaborate
- Collaborate with like-minded researchers in another area of development to create corpora of data with shared coding schemes and other metadata.
- Comment on datasets shared by others; add tags to help others mine datasets.
