# How To Guide

This How-To Guide provides information useful for [researchers](|filename|guide/for-users.md) and [institutions](|filename|guide/for-institutions.md) who wish to use Databrary.

## About Databrary

Databrary is a restricted access research data library specialized for
storing, streaming, and sharing video and audio recordings and related
research data.
Databrary's mission is to support data sharing among researchers
in the behavioral, social, educational, developmental, neural, and
computer sciences.

### Protecting participants and accelerating discovery

Widespread data sharing will accelerate discovery and make research more transparent, robust, and reproducible.
To realize the full benefits of sharing data about human and non-human animals, research participants and their data must be protected.
The responsibility for protecting participants and data is shared among researchers, institutions, and Databrary.

Databrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering data sharing while
upholding ethical research principles.
Access is restricted to
Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by their
institution.
Institutions must provide ethics oversight of Authorized
Investigators through a research ethics board or Institutional Review
Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that required to secure
[Federalwide Assurance (FWA)](ttps://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/) status from the U.S. Government.
Authorized Investigators who share human data with others must secure
permission to share from research participants and record that
permission level for each file stored on Databrary.
In turn, Authorized
Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other
Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles,
including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research
participants.
Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights
of research participants while reducing barriers to data sharing.

### Types of data

Databrary stores and shares images, video, and audio recordings that may
include identifiable information, data and metadata that are not
typically sensitive, and de-identified data.
Exact birth dates may be
stored for use in calculating exact ages, but exact birth dates are only
exposed to Authorized Investigators or Affiliates given specific access
to data.
Names, addresses, email addresses, financial information,
government ID numbers, detailed geographic location information, and
other personally identifiable data elements are **not** stored or shared
on Databrary.

Databrary stores metadata related to full datasets (e.g., title,
authors, related publications, description of the dataset, keywords or
tags, associated URLs), individual study sessions (e.g. metadata related
to participants, study groups and conditions, location, language, and
session date and tasks), and video files (e.g., title, duration, tags)
related to a dataset.

#### Supported File Formats

This is the list of file formats which Databrary currently accepts.
Note that all video formats will be automatically transcoded to mp4 format.
If you have files in other formats you wish to share, just contact us so that we can add appropriate handling.

### Sharing release levels

To make it clear to participants and researchers the level of access granted to specific files, Databrary developed a set of standard sharing release levels that are indicated with consistent icons and language across the site.

> **NOTE:** All files uploaded to Databrary are labeled *Private* by default.
> This makes files visible only to the Authorized Investigator and 
> specific users chosen by the Authorized Investigator *unless the Authorized Investigator 
> chooses otherwise*.
> Each file's release level must be specifically changed by an Authorized Investigator (or an 
> Affiliate with suitable privileges) before a file is shared more widely.

| Level | Definition | Icon |
|------|-------|------------|
| *Unknown* | Consent missing or not obtained. This content is not shared and access is restricted to specific people selected by an Authorized Investigator. | <img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/unknown.svg"> |
| *Private* | This content is not shared and access is restricted to specific people selected by an Authorized Investigator (Default). | <img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/private.svg"> |
| *Authorized Users* | This content is restricted to authorized Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted access to shared Databrary data) and may not be redistributed in any form. | <img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/shared.svg"> |
| *Learning Audiences* |  This content is restricted to authorized Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted access to shared Databrary data), who may use clips or images from it in presentations for informational or educational purposes. Note, such presentations may be videotaped or recorded and those videos or recordings may then be made available to the public via the internet (e.g., YouTube). | <img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/excerpts.svg"> |
| *Public* | This content is available openly to anyone. | <img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/public.svg"> |

All Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must follow the restrictions
on uses indicated by these release levels.
Furthermore, when using files released for access by *Learning Audiences*, Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must exercise professional judgment in deciding which clips or images to show to what audiences and in what contexts.

### Non-research uses

Many uses of Databrary do not constitute research (e.g., browsing shared
videos, downloading videos of displays or procedures, or showing
excerpts in research or educational presentations). Authorized
Investigators (and their Affiliates) must follow Institutional policies
concerning whether specific non-research uses of Databrary require prior
institutional approval. Moreover, Authorized Investigators and
Affiliates must always respect the release level associated with shared
files. For example, data marked with an *Authorized Users* (<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/shared.svg" width='5%'>) release level may only be viewed in research contexts (e.g., in the Authorized
Investigator's laboratory) by the Authorized Investigator or people
under the supervision of the Authorized Investigator. Similarly, only
those data with a release level of *Learning Audiences* (<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/excerpts.svg" width='5%'>) or *Public* (<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/public.svg" width='5%'>) may
be shown in research or educational presentations outside the Authorized
Investigator's laboratory.

### Research uses

Authorized Investigators must secure institutional approvals prior to
conducting research with data shared on Databrary. In the U.S. context,
conducting secondary analysis on shared video data may not qualify as
human subjects research because there is no direct contact with research
participants. Still, a research project involving video data reuse may
require ethics board or IRB review and approval because the data are
identifiable.
