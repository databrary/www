Many users want to know how to incorporate Databrary and data-sharing in funding proposals to agencies like the U.S. National Science Foundation or National Institutes of Health.

We have developed template [language](|filename|grant/dmp-template.mdi) to help researchers who plan to store and share data in Databrary.

Researchers should confirm funding agency, directorate, or program-specific resource sharing plans or data management plan requirements.

Also, if your proposal gets funded, send us your Data Management Plan so that we can update the template and others can benefit.
