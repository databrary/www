Title: Ethics-related support
Brief: Ethics-related support
Order: 2000

Databrary strives to uphold the highest research ethics while maximizing open and secure access to research data.
We achieve this through multiple means:

- Requiring that researchers fulfill all institutional requirements, including ethics board or IRB review if needed, in order to use Databrary materials.
- Providing researchers with [template language](|filename|irb/irb-application.mdi) that may be used to apply for and secure ethics board approval.
- Requiring researchers to ask research participants for their permission to share data and providing [template language](|filename|irb/release-template.mdi) to guide the process.
- Providing a sample participant data sharing release [script](|filename|irb/script.md) and example [videos of the data sharing release process](|filename|irb/examples.md).
- Developing consistent terminology and visual icons for documenting [sharing release levels](|filename|irb/release-levels.md).
