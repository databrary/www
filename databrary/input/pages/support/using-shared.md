Title: Using shared data
Brief: Using shared data
Order: 1800

Databrary's materials and data are intended to accelerate discovery.
The [Databrary Access Agreement and Annexes](https://databrary.org/about/agreement/agreement.html) and the [Terms and Conditions of Use](https://databrary.org/about/policies/terms.html) provide formal guidance about policies related to contributing and using data.
Here are some recommended best practices for re-using data on the system:

- Consider how you intend to use the materials. *Pre-research* uses (e.g., evaluating the feasibility of a coding scheme on a handful of videos) and *non-research* (e.g. showing a clip in class) may not requre IRB or ethics board approval.
*Research* uses almost always require ethics board or IRB approval. Consult your institution's ethics board or IRB to determine whether your intended use is or isn't research, and proceed accordingly.
**Note**: Most of the data shared on Databrary are consistent with broad consent, meaning that participants or parents have given permission for unspecified future uses of the data.
- Follow the [sharing release levels](https://databrary.org/support/irb/release-levels.html) indicated for each file. Some data on Databrary are *public*,  (<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/public.svg">) and may be used for a broad range of non-commercial purposes. Other data are shared with *learning audiences* (<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/excerpts.svg">). These data permit an authorized user to show clips or excerpts in public settings like classrooms and talks. Still other data are shared with *authorized users* (<img src="https://nyu.databrary.org/web/icons/release/shared.svg">). These data may be used for research purposes in a lab context, for example, but clips or excerpts may *not* be shown in public settings.
- If you download and use materials from Databrary, you are *not* required to seek permission from the researchers who uploaded the data originally. However, you may choose to contact those researchers as a courtesy.
- Follow institutional guidelines and best data security practices when planning *where* to download and store data from Databrary.
- Consider carefully *who* will access downloaded data. Authorized Investigators are responsible for selecting, training, and supervising the activity of the people who will access data downloaded from Databrary.
- If you use materials from Databrary, you *should* cite them using the citation provided.
