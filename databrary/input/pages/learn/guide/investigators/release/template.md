Title: Adding the Databrary Release to Your IRB Protocol
Brief: The Databrary Release
Order: 3220

## Adapting the Databrary Release Template 

The [Databrary Release template](|filename|../../../../../templates/release-template) has been developed in close consultation with IRB officials at NYU and PSU.

It clearly explains to people depicted in recordings or photographs what it would mean to share their data in Databrary and allows them to make an informed decision about doing so.

The template is **completely** adaptable.
Researchers may modify it as appropriate to suit the needs of their project.

Databrary does not need to approve changes to the template: only the home IRB must approve the version that is given to participants.
You can read more about the [release process](|filename|asking.md) in order to inform your decisions about how to adapt the template to your needs.

## Technical assistance

Local, state, and national regulations and laws differ, as do the practices of each IRB (or their equivalents).
