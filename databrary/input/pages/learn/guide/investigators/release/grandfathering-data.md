Title: Grandfathering Already Collected Data 
Brief: Grandfathering Data
Order: 3250

Many researchers already seek permission from participants to show clips from recordings for educational and scientific purposes.
Some IRBs have determined that the language used in these permission or release forms is equivalent to [Databrary's Release Template](|filename|../../../policies/release-template.mdi).

This means that some data researchers have already collected may be eligible for sharing with Databrary.

## Is your current release "Databrary-equivalent"?

Does your release permit you to show or reuse recordings for educational and scientific purposes?

If you already use a video/audio or photo release form and want to find out whether you can share with Databrary, follow the following steps.

1. Seek formal permission from your IRB
	- If your release permits you to show recordings in educational or scientific settings, then you may apply for formal permission from your IRB to share these recordings with Databrary.
1. Determine what [sharing permission level](|filename|release-levels.md) applies
	- You will have to determine whether your current release means that recordings can be shared only for research use by other Databrary Investigators or whether clips from those recordings can be shown in educational and scientific contexts.
1. Share data with Databrary
	- You may create a new dataset or study yourself or [contact Databrary](mailto:help@databrary.org) for help in doing so.

### Databrary intends to store Data indefinitely

Some IRBs encourage researchers to include promises to destroy Data, especially recordings, after some fixed time period in order to limit risk to participants.
Data destruction is antithetical to data sharing, and Databrary's Template Release language seeks explicit permission to share data indefinitely.
NIH and NSF **do not** require data destruction clauses.
Researchers who wish to store Data on Databrary should remove data destruction clauses from their informed consent documents for new Data and seek IRB guidance about whether archival Data can be shared.
