Title: Organizing Your Data
Brief: Organizing Your Data
Order: 3330

We organize data in terms of what we call **sessions**, **datasets**, and **studies**.
You will need to consider how to organize your data within this structure.

# Levels of Organization

## Session

Databrary is designed so that the most basic unit of organization is a session.
We consider a **session** to be a specific period of time during which data were collected from a participant or participants, typically a single visit.
Sessions are like folders that contain all the raw data collected during this visit, including videos, survey responses, or other measurements or observations.

## Dataset

We then collect sessions into a **dataset**.
Datasets typically reflect a set of related procedures or data from a group of participants observed longitudinally.
Datasets can be as big or as small as suits your research design.
Often a dataset is equivalent to a single research study, but one dataset can also span multiple studies or multiple datasets can be combined into a single study.
Datasets include everything you did to collect your raw video data, so if available you can include a description of your collection protocol, stimuli or displays shown to participants, blank questionnaires or consent forms used, funding proposals, etc.

## Study

Once you have one or more datasets, you can create what we call a **study** to represent a research product.
Typically, a study represents a single published paper or other research product, but it could also reflect unpublished research.
Often a study and a dataset are the same, but a study can be made up of sessions from multiple datasets, or can be a subset of a dataset.
Studies can also other relevant information, including links to published papers, coding manuals, coding spreadsheets, analyses files, figures, graphs, presentations, and other metadata associated with the analysis of your data.

# Exclusions and Pilots

In any study, there are going to be participants that are not included in final analysis for many reasons.
Maybe you were trying to determine how to run a session with pilot participants, or a participant was unable to complete a task.
You are encouraged to share these sessions with Databrary, but you will want to make it clear that these sessions were not included in a final research project.

Accordingly, you can mark the sessions that were not included in a study and note why.
Refer to [Definitions of Suggested Fields](|filename|definitions.md) for more information.

# Longitudinal Studies

It may be that you conduct multi-visit or longitudinal studies where you keep track of the same participants.
Databrary can organize your data this way as long as you provide consistent subject IDs.
You can collect the different visits as different datasets, or organize your datasets by the types of tasks participants completed, create datasets that are defined by both visit and task, or organize your data in other ways.
