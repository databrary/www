<section class="question">
	<h3>What is Databrary?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Databrary is a digital data library that is specialized for storing, managing, preserving, analyzing, and sharing video and other temporally dense streams of data. Our mission is to promote sharing and reuse of video data. We seek to provide data management and organization tools, facilitate open data sharing, enable discovery, and foster data reuse and integration.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>What are some ways I might use it?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>There are many ways a researcher might use Databrary from teaching to research. See some suggested use cases <a href="/about/use-cases.html">here</a>.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>How do I access shared data?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Some Databrary materials are shared with the general public. But, access to most data, especially identifiable or sensitive materials, is limited to people with authorization. You may browse Databrary's public information freely without authorization.</p>
		<p>Investigators must be authorized through their university or institution to have <a href='/resources/guide/investigators.html'>access</a> to shared data in the library.</p>
		<p>The <a href='/resources/agreement.html'>Databrary Access Agreement</a> must be signed by both the <em>authorized investigator</em> and the Institution; an <em>affiliate</em> must be sponsored by an <em>authorized investigator</em>. You can <a href="/register">register</a> today to begin the authorization process.</p>
	</div>
</section>
<section class="question">
	<h3>How do I cite data from Databrary?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Every volume is provided with a Databrary specific citation. Please go to the volume page and use the citation listed under "How To Cite" to ensure that the contributor receives proper credit.</p>
		<p>Please also <a href='/resources/guide/investigators/citing.html'>reference Databrary and Datavyu</a> in your publication, if you used Databrary to share, store, or manage your own research data, shared videos or clips illustrating your procedure or findings, used Datavyu to code your data, or if you reused an existing Databrary volume.</p>
	</div>
</section>
<section class="question">
	<h3>Why should I contribute to an open data sharing library?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Data sharing embodies the ideals of open scientific inquiry. It contributes to transparency and bolsters scientific integrity.</p>
		<p>A history and commitment of sharing data may enhance the likelihood of funding. Federal funding agencies and private foundations are now requesting data management and data sharing plans. Your work will receive more citations. Users will cite your dataset or tools and the papers associated with them.</p>
		<p>The more investigators who share and the more information they share, the more the community of researchers will benefit, the more scientists will discover, and the more the public will benefit from the accelerated pace of discovery about human behavior and development.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>What can I contribute?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Databrary is specialized for storing and sharing video and audio recordings. You may share examples of computer-based displays or other supplemental materials associated with a published study or conference presentation such as manuscript drafts, coded spreadsheets, codebooks, questionnaires, instruments, or analysis spreadsheets.</p>
		<p>Databrary encourages contributors to share important contextual information about the recordings such as information about the setting (e.g., date, time, location), participants (e.g., age or grade-level, sex, handedness, race, ethnicity, disability), and measures (e.g., video, survey, computer-task). These rich forms of metadata will help users to search, browse, and reuse datasets.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>Will I receive credit for my contributions if other researchers use my data?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Yes. Users sign an agreement stating that they will acknowledge contributors by citing any Databrary resources that they use. Databrary will provide permanent identifiers and a standard citation format.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>When do I contribute?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Data contributors can upload data at any point.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>When should I share data?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Funding agency requirements and journal standards about data sharing are evolving. Databrary's philosophy about Data Sharing is embodied in our <a href='/resources/policies/data-sharing-manifesto.html'>Data Sharing Manifesto</a>. We believe sharing data will accelerate the pace of discovery and will lead to stronger, more transparent science. Unless required by journals or funding agencies, you are never required by Databrary to share data if you do not wish to do so.</p>
		<p>Sharing data is easier when you have the intent to share from the beginning of a data collection. We recommend collecting and storing data on Databrary from the beginning of a study so when you’re finished running it, sharing the study simply requires a click of one button. We call this process “Upload as you go.”</p>
		<p>Sharing can happen at any point in a study. You might not know exactly when you want to share but we suggest getting permission to share from your participants so you have the ability to share your data in the future.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>Can I share data I've already collected?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Some investigators already ask research participants for permission to share <a href='/resources/policies/definitions.html#recordings'>recordings</a> with other researchers or to show them for educational or scientific purposes. This permission is often acquired by means of a video, audio or photograph release form that is similar to Databrary's. 
		In this case, some recordings that have already been collected might be shared with Databrary. If you have language that gives you permission to share or show recordings, you may apply to share these data with Databrary if your IRB rules that your release language is equivalent to Databrary's, or that your data require no such release to share.
		See <a href='/resources/guide/investigators/release/grandfathering-data.html'>Grandfathering Data</a> for more information.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>What about privacy?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Because video and audio recordings and photographs may depict faces, voices, names, or other personally identifying information, special care must be taken. The principles of informed consent enable participants to decide for themselves whether or not they will allow their data to be shared with other researchers for other research purposes. The people depicted must give explicit permission for the recordings or photographs to be shared with Databrary. Databrary has created <a href='/resources/policies/release-template.html'>template documents</a> for this purpose.</p>
		<p>In other data formats such as text files and spreadsheets, participants must not be denoted by names or initials. Personally identifying information must be removed before data are contributed. Databrary recommends that authorized investigators adopt <a href='/resources/policies/best-practices.html'>best practices for data security</a> and uphold the <a href='/resources/policies/bill-of-rights.html'>Databrary Bill of Rights</a>.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>Do I have to use <a href="http://datavyu.org">Datavyu</a> to contribute data?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>No. Contributors are not required to score their videos with the Datavyu coding tool. However, we are happy to offer Datavyu as an option to the community because it is free and open source.</p>
		<p>We will work towards round trip interoperability between Databrary and coding tools used by the community.</p>

<section class="question">
	<h3>What is the difference between tags and keywords?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>A keyword is defined by the contributor and serves as a reference to the major concepts that apply to the work. They are frequently the keywords associated with a published study. A tag is defined by a member of the community. It represents the concepts and labels that can be applied to the data. Both enable more in depth search of volumes and videos.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>How do I tag my videos?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>You can create volume level tags at the bottom of the volume page. You can also create temporal tags on specific parts of videos from the timeline.</p>
	</div>
</section>

<section class="question">
	<h3>I just shared my volume. Why can't my colleague download a data file?</h3>
	<div>
		<p>Databrary restricts access to data files based on the permission level you have selected for that file. It might be that your colleague is not an authorized Databrary user or is not logged in. It is also possible that the permission level you have set for the data file is set to Unreleased or Private, which limits access to you and your affiliates. You can select a higher release level if you have participants' permission to share with other researchers.</p>
