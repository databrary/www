				<h2 id="annex-iii-databrary-access-guide">Annex III -- Databrary Access Guide</h2>
<p><em>Version date: April 29, 2020</em></p>
<p>This Databrary Access Guide provides information useful for Institutions
and Authorized Investigators who wish to use Databrary's services.</p>
<h3 id="for-institutions">For Institutions</h3>
<p>Databrary is a restricted access data library specialized for storing,
streaming, and sharing of video and audio recordings. Databrary's
mission is to support the sharing of video and audio recordings and
related data collected as part of research in the social, behavioral,
educational, and neural sciences.</p>
<p>The responsibility for protecting research data and research
participants is shared among Authorized Investigators and their
Affiliates, Institutions, and Databrary.</p>
<p>Databrary has a multi-pronged approach to fostering the sharing of video
and related data while upholding ethical research principles. Access is
restricted to Authorized Investigators whose access must be approved by
their Institution. Institutions must provide ethics oversight of
Authorized Investigators through a research ethics board or
Institutional Review Board (IRB) with standards equivalent to that
required to secure Federalwide Assurance (FWA) status from the U.S.
Government (see:
https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/register-irbs-and-obtain-fwas/index.html).
Authorized Investigators who share data with others must secure
permission to share from research participants and record that
permission level for each file stored on Databrary. In turn, Authorized
Investigators who access Databrary and use data shared by other
Authorized Investigators must follow ethical research principles,
including respect for the sharing permissions granted by research
participants. Taken together, these features aim to protect the rights
of research participants while reducing barriers to sharing data.</p>
<h4 id="the-databrary-access-agreement-permits-data-use-and-data-contribution">The Databrary Access Agreement permits data use and data contribution</h4>
<p>Databrary restricts access to Authorized Investigators whose
Institutions sign a formal Databrary Access Agreement.</p>
<p>The Databrary Access Agreement combines provisions for data use and data
contribution. Unlike data use agreements that allow specific individuals
access to a particular dataset for a discrete research purpose, the
Databrary Access Agreement allows any Authorized Investigator to access
all shared datasets on Databrary and use the datasets for many different
Institutionally-approved purposes. In addition, the Databrary Access
Agreement permits Authorized Investigators to upload data and to share
it with other Authorized Investigators in accord with the sharing
permissions granted by participants and any required Institutional
approvals. Databrary believes that combining data use and data
contribution in a single agreement reduces barriers to data sharing,
meets emerging funder mandates to share research data, and accelerates
progress in research.</p>
<h4 id="videos-use-cases-extend-beyond-research">Video's use cases extend beyond research</h4>
<p>In addition to its many uses in research, video may be used for a
variety of pre-research and non-research uses, such as the documentation
of methodological details, the demonstration of computer-based tasks, or
the showing of video clips for teaching or scientific presentations.
Databrary encourages the storage and sharing of video for all of these
purposes, in a manner consistent with subject permissions and
institutional approvals.</p>
<h4 id="institutions-determine-when-research-ethics-board-or-irb-approval-is-necessary">Institutions determine when research ethics board or IRB approval is necessary</h4>
<p>Databrary does not require prior research ethics board or IRB approval
for an Authorized Investigator to be granted access to the system or to
use Databrary's shared resources for non-research, educational, or
pre-research uses. However, in signing the Databrary Access Agreement,
all Authorized Investigators promise to secure research ethics approval
whenever their use of Databrary requires it under the Institution's
policies.</p>
<p>Non-research, educational, or pre-research use cases may not require
research ethics board or IRB review and approval at every institution.
Institutions decide which use cases require research ethics board or IRB
review and approval.</p>
<h4 id="what-data-are-shared">What data are shared</h4>
<p>Databrary contains images, video, and audio recordings that may be
identifiable, data and metadata that are not typically sensitive, and
de-identified data. Exact birth dates may be stored for use in
calculating exact ages, but exact birth dates are only exposed to
Authorized Investigators or Affiliates given specific access to data.
Names, addresses, email addresses, financial information, government ID
numbers, detailed geographic location information, and other personally
identifiable data elements are <strong>not</strong> stored and shared on Databrary.</p>
<h4 id="securing-permission-to-share">Securing permission to share</h4>
<p>In order to contribute and share identifiable data with Databrary,
Authorized Investigators must secure permission to store the recordings
on Databrary from research participants and any other people (e.g.,
research staff) who are recorded.</p>
<p>Databrary has developed a Sharing Release Template that informs people
depicted in recordings of the potential risks associated with sharing
video and other data on Databrary. The Sharing Release Template is one
of the resources that Databrary has made available to researchers. The
Sharing Release Template may be adapted for use at any Institution and
added to any research ethics or IRB protocol. However, an Institution
may require other release language in order to provide equivalent
protections.</p>
<p>Whether de-identified or pseudonymized data may be shared with Databrary
without seeking explicit permission from research participants depends
on the Authorized Investigator's Institution. Some ethics boards or
IRBs may allow de-identified or pseudonymized data to be shared without
the explicit permission of the research participant.</p>
<h4 id="uploading-data-and-assigning-sharing-permission-levels">Uploading data and assigning sharing permission levels</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators who upload data to Databrary must assign to
each file uploaded the level of data sharing granted by research
participants---from none to public access. The sharing level assigned to
each file by default is <em>Private</em>, meaning that no person other than the
Authorized Investigator who uploaded the file and any Affiliates granted
access by the Authorized Investigator, may view the file.</p>
<p>Not only are data files assigned a <em>Private</em> sharing level by default,
but all newly created datasets are initially made <em>Private</em>, accessible
only to an Authorized Investigator, any Affiliates the Authorized
Investigator selects, and any other individual Authorized Investigators
granted specific access to the dataset. An Authorized Investigator may
elect to create an overview of a dataset when it is created and make the
overview publicly available. The overview can serve as the public face
of the dataset while the dataset is being collected and analyzed. This
can be useful in documenting progress on a research grant to sponsors.
The dataset overview does not expose data unless the Authorized
Investigator chooses to do so.</p>
<h4 id="sharing-data">Sharing data</h4>
<p>At a time when the Authorized Investigator chooses---e.g., when a paper
goes to press or a grant period ends---the Authorized Investigator may
choose to share the dataset with other Authorized Investigators on
Databrary. This makes the data contained in the dataset available to
other Authorized Investigators and possibly the public, but only in
accordance with the sharing levels selected by Authorized Investigators
and always subject to the permission granted by participants. That is,
individual data files marked <em>Private</em> remain accessible only to people
the Authorized Investigator specifically selects. Similarly, access to
datasets labeled <em>Private</em> remains solely under the control of the
Authorized Investigator.</p>
<h4 id="databrary-and-gdpr">Databrary and GDPR</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators may collect personal data from research
participants who have rights under the General Data Protection
Regulation (GDPR). GDPR governs the collection of personal data in the
European Economic Area (EEA).</p>
<p>Databrary's servers are currently located in the United States, and
data stored on Databrary may be accessed, downloaded, and re-used by
Authorized Investigators and their Affiliates located outside of the
EEA. There are more than 500 Institutions across the globe that have
signed the Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary maintains a list of
Authorized Investigators who have access to shared research data at
<a href="https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&amp;f.party_authorization=4&amp;f.party_is_institution=false">https://nyu.databrary.org/search?volume=false&amp;f.party_authorization=4&amp;f.party_is_institution=false</a>.</p>
<p>In seeking permission to collect data from research participants
governed by GDPR or similar provisions, Authorized Investigators should
communicate to research participants information about who may have
access to shared data on Databrary and where the data are stored.
Institutions and Authorized Investigators assume responsibility for
ensuring that research participants give sharing data permission that
satisfies the provisions of GDPR and for abiding by other provisions of
GDPR.</p>
<p>Databrary does not typically store information that links a person's
identity to specific files unless there is a separate agreement between
the Authorized Investigator, the Institution, and Databrary to store
this type of data. Therefore, if a research participant requests a copy
of data stored on Databrary or the modification or deletion of personal
data that is stored on Databrary, the Authorized Investigator or
Institution is responsible for responding to the request, not Databrary.
Also, Databrary cannot guarantee that data previously shared with other
Authorized Investigators via Databrary can be retrieved from all
Authorized Investigators who accessed a participant's personal data
prior to its modification or removal. Thus, Authorized Investigators
should communicate to research participants that there are limits to a
participant's right to modify or delete personal data that have already
been shared on Databrary. The Databrary Release Template contains
language for this purpose.</p>
<p>When accessing data shared by other Authorized Investigators,
Institutions and their Authorized Investigators assume responsibility
for ensuring that the sharing permission research participants have
given in other contexts outside of the EEA meet relevant GDPR
provisions.</p>
<h4 id="when-authorized-investigators-leave-an-institution">When Authorized Investigators leave an Institution</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators are expected to inform Databrary when they
leave an Institution. Institutions may also inform Databrary.</p>
<p>Access to non-public data shared with other Authorized Investigators
will be suspended when an Authorized Investigator leaves an Institution.
The suspension extends to an Authorized Investigators' Affiliates.
Authorized Investigators will continue to have password-protected access
to data they uploaded to Databrary once they leave an Institution. When
a new Institution grants authorization, Authorized Investigators will
regain access to non-public data shared by other Authorized
Investigators.</p>
<p>If an Authorized Investigator retires, is incapacitated due to illness,
or dies, the Institution should inform Databrary so that the Authorized
Investigator's account may be suspended. An Institution may choose to
designate a data steward for the Authorized Investigator's data and
authorize that person to manage access to the data. If the Institution
does not identify and authorize a data steward, Databrary staff will
serve that role. However, the Databrary staff serving as data steward
will not change the data sharing status of any specific dataset without
explicit written guidance from the Institution.</p>
<h4 id="selecting-affiliates">Selecting Affiliates</h4>
<p>If permitted by their Institution, an Authorized Investigator may grant
a person outside their Institution Affiliate status. Institutions may
establish policies governing the selection and management of Affiliates
by their Authorized Investigators.</p>
<p>If a person is eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home
Institution, that person must apply for access to Databrary through
their home Institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers
eligible to be Authorized Investigators at their home Institution should
not be granted access to Databrary as the Affiliate of another
Authorized Investigator either from the same Institution or a different
one. Databrary welcomes questions about these policies. Please email

<h3 id="for-researchers">For Researchers</h3>
<p>This section explains how to apply for authorization, select and manage
affiliates, collect data that can be shared, upload and manage datasets
and studies, and explore, re-use, and extend the resources shared with
Databrary.</p>
<h4 id="getting-authorized">Getting Authorized</h4>
<p>Some materials on Databrary are available to the public, but access to
most data requires that a person secure formal written authorization
from an Institution. The Databrary Access Agreement is the legally
binding document that formalizes the authorization process.</p>
<p>Individuals who are eligible to conduct independent research, submit
funding proposals as the lead investigator, have Principal Investigator
(PI) status, or have tenure-track faculty positions at their
Institution, may apply to their Institution for approval to be named an
Authorized Investigator. To receive authorization a person must apply
for and receive authorization from their Institution; Databrary does not
grant authorization separate from an Institution. In the U.S., a college
or university's grants and contracts or sponsored programs office
usually takes responsibility for granting authorization by signing the
Databrary Access Agreement. Databrary staff will work with a researcher
and an Institution to secure signatures on the Databrary Access
Agreement. The authorization process typically takes a few days to a few
weeks.</p>
<h3 id="selecting-and-managing-affiliates">Selecting and managing Affiliates</h3>
<p>Once authorized by their Institution, Authorized Investigators may then
authorize staff, undergraduate or graduate students, or postdoctoral
trainees to access Databrary as Affiliates. In granting a person
Affiliate status, an Authorized Investigator takes responsibility for
that person's use of Databrary.</p>
<p>An Authorized Investigator may grant a person outside their Institution
Affiliate status if permitted by their Institution. If a person is
eligible to be an Authorized Investigator at their home Institution,
that person should apply for access to Databrary through their home
Institution. Except in unusual circumstances, researchers eligible to be
Authorized Investigators should not be granted access to Databrary as
the Affiliate of another Authorized Investigator.</p>
<p>Authorized Investigators are responsible for ensuring that Affiliates
have human subjects and/or animal research training appropriate for the
Institution and remain in good standing with the Institution.</p>
<h4 id="affiliate-access-to-an-authorized-investigators-data">Affiliate access to an Authorized Investigator's data</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators determine which of the Authorized
Investigator's datasets an Affiliate has access to. Authorized
Investigators can set each Affiliate's access to one of the following
levels:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>No access</em>: Affiliate cannot access any of the Authorized
    Investigator's data. This is the default.</li>
<li><em>Read-only access</em>: Affiliate has view access to all of the
    Authorized Investigator's data. (The affiliate may view and
    download videos and other identifying information, including data
    that is not released for sharing.)</li>
<li><em>Read/Write Access</em>: Affiliate can access and edit all of the
    Authorized Investigator's. (The affiliate may view, download, add,
    change, and remove data as the Authorized Investigator without
    restriction.)</li>
<li><em>Manager</em>: Affiliate can access and change permissions on all of the
    Authorized Investigator's data. (The Affiliate may additionally
    change the access controls and sharing levels of the Authorized
    Investigator's data. Manager-level permission should be granted
    with utmost care.)</li>
</ul>
<p>These levels are analogous to granting an Affiliate different levels of
access to the Authorized Investigator's laboratory data server.
Accordingly, the Investigator must trust Affiliates granted this access
and supervise and manage Affiliates granted these privileges. The
Authorized Investigator must assign an expiration date to each
Affiliate's access.</p>
<h4 id="affiliate-access-to-databrary">Affiliate access to Databrary</h4>
<p>Affiliates can only gain access to data on Databrary that has been
shared by <em>other</em> Authorized Investigators if specifically granted that
access by their supervising Authorized Investigator. The Authorized
Investigator must assign an expiration date to each Affiliate's access.</p>
<p>Many Authorized Investigators grant Affiliates access only to datasets
the Authorized Investigator controls, not to other datasets shared on
Databrary. Some Authorized Investigators grant access to datasets shared
on Databrary to senior graduate students, postdoctoral trainees, or
trusted research staff.</p>
<h4 id="accessing-data-shared-by-others">Accessing data shared by others</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators automatically have access to data on Databrary
that has been shared by other Authorized Investigators. Affiliates only
have access to shared data on Databrary only if granted that access by
the Authorized Investigator who supervises them.</p>
<h3 id="release-levels">Release levels</h3>
<p>In order to make it clear to participants and researchers what level of
access should be granted to specific files, Databrary has developed a
set of standard release levels. These levels are indicated with
consistent icons and language across the site. The levels are as
follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unknown</em>. Consent missing or not obtained. This content is not
    shared and access is restricted to specific people selected by an
    Authorized Investigator.</li>
<li><em>Private</em>. This content is not shared and access is restricted to
    specific people selected by an Authorized Investigator. <em>Note</em>: This
    is the default for all files and must be specifically changed by an
    Authorized Investigator (or an Affiliate with suitable privileges).</li>
<li><em>Authorized Users</em>. This content is restricted to authorized
    Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted
    access to shared Databrary data) and may not be redistributed in any
    form.</li>
<li><em>Learning Audiences</em>. This content is restricted to authorized
    Databrary users (Authorized Investigators and Affiliates granted
    access to shared Databrary data), who may use clips or images from
    it in presentations for informational or educational purposes. Note
    that such presentations may be videotaped or recorded and those
    videos or recordings may then be made available to the public via
    the internet (e.g., YouTube).</li>
<li><em>Public</em>. This content is available openly to anyone.</li>
</ul>
<p>All Authorized Investigators and Affiliates must follow the restrictions
on uses indicated by these release levels. Furthermore, when using files
released for access by <em>Learning Audiences</em> Authorized Investigators and
Affiliates must exercise professional judgment in deciding what clips or
images to show to what audiences and in what contexts.</p>
<h3 id="non-research-uses">Non-research uses</h3>
<p>Many uses of Databrary do not constitute research, for example, browsing
shared videos, downloading videos of displays or procedures, or showing
excerpts in research or educational presentations. Authorized
Investigators (and their Affiliates) must follow Institutional policies
concerning whether specific non-research uses of Databrary require prior
Institutional approval. Moreover, Authorized Investigators and
Affiliates must always respect the release level associated with shared
files. For example, data marked with an <em>Authorized Users</em> release level
may only be viewed in research contexts (e.g., in the Authorized
Investigator's laboratory) by the Authorized Investigator or people
under the supervision of the Authorized Investigator. Similarly, only
those data with a release level of <em>Learning Audiences</em> or <em>Public</em> may
be shown in research or educational presentations outside the Authorized
Investigator's laboratory.</p>
<h3 id="research-uses">Research uses</h3>
<p>Authorized Investigators must secure Institutional approvals prior to
conducting research with data shared on Databrary. In the U.S. context,
conducting secondary analysis on shared video data may not qualify as
human subjects research because there is no direct contact with research
participants. Still, a research project involving video data reuse may
require ethics board or IRB review and approval because the data are
identifiable.</p>
<h3 id="contributing-new-data">Contributing new data</h3>
<p>Only Authorized Investigators may create new datasets, and only
Authorized Investigators may share datasets with others.</p>
<h4 id="non-sensitivenon-identifiable-data-or-materials">Non-sensitive/non-identifiable data or materials</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators may upload to Databrary and share
non-identifiable videos of research procedures, computer displays,
research protocols, analysis code, or other research materials without
any additional approvals, provided that sharing these elements with
Databrary does not violate intellectual property rights of any person.
De-identified or pseudonymized research data may be uploaded and shared
subject to Institutional policies and approval. If an Authorized
Investigator already has approval to share a de-identified or
pseudonymized dataset with other researchers or with the public, then
sharing that dataset on Databrary is permitted. All files uploaded to
Databrary must be marked with a sharing release level. The default
sharing release level is <em>Private</em>. While many
non-sensitive/de-identified or pseudonymized data files could be made
available to the public, it may be prudent to share de-identified or
pseudonymized datasets only with Authorized Investigators.</p>
<h4 id="identifiable-or-sensitive-data">Identifiable or sensitive data</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators must make preparations to share identifiable or
sensitive data with Databrary. The next section describes some of these
preparations.</p>
<h5 id="securing-institutional-approval">Securing Institutional approval</h5>
<p>Authorized Investigators must secure approval from their Institutions
prior to sharing data with Databrary. Institutional approval usually
involves research ethics board or IRB review or its equivalent. Approval
to share data may be included in a new research protocol application or
as an amendment to an existing protocol.</p>
<p>For human subjects data, Databrary recommends adapting the Databrary
Release Template although the exact Databrary Release Template language
is not required. The Databrary Release Template serves as a guideline.
The Institutional research ethics board or IRB must determine what
specific language should be used for securing data sharing permission
and whether requesting permission to share data should be part of the
research consent process or separate from it. It is essential that
whatever language and permission process the Institution requires
enables the Authorized Investigator to determine clearly what level of
sharing release participants have granted. Authorized Investigators must
be able to assign a sharing release level to each file uploaded to
Databrary that reflects the sharing permission granted by the research
participant.</p>
<p>In some cases, research ethics boards and IRBs have deemed that certain
release language in research consent forms from previously collected
data permits sharing in Databrary. This has made archival data collected
prior to the creation of Databrary to be stored and shared in the
library. If an Authorized Investigator has archival data, Databrary
staff are happy to discuss whether and how these might be stored and
shared on the system.</p>
<h5 id="removing-data-destruction-clauses">Removing data destruction clauses</h5>
<p>There are often misconceptions about regulations pertaining to data
destruction, especially where video or audio recordings are concerned.
In the U.S., NIH and NSF do not require data destruction. Data
destruction clauses inherently conflict with the ability to store and
share data indefinitely via repositories like Databrary. Rather than
promising to destroy data after some time period in a research protocol,
Databrary recommends the following language: "Data will be stored for
an indefinite period in a restricted data library on the internet
(databrary.org)."</p>
<h5 id="obtaining-participant-release-for-sharing">Obtaining participant release for sharing</h5>
<p>Once research protocol approval has been granted, Authorized
Investigators may start securing permission from participants and
recording those permissions.</p>
<p>Authorized Investigators must ensure that the process used for obtaining
participant release for sharing meets relevant regulatory requirements,
e.g. GDPR.</p>
<h6 id="why-ask">Why ask</h6>
<p>Video and audio recordings of participants are inherently identifiable.
In order to share identifiable data on Databrary Authorized
Investigators must secure permission from the people depicted in
recordings or images. Authorized Investigators can share identifiable
research recordings (or other identifiable data elements like birth
dates) only when the Authorized Investigators (a) get approval from
their Institutions to do so, (b) inform participants about what sharing
these data elements means, and (c) secure participants' permission to
share. Databrary calls this data sharing permission a "release" since
it involves releasing data for use by other researchers.</p>
<h6 id="when-to-ask">When to ask</h6>
<p>Databrary recommends that Authorized Investigators ask participants for
permission to share at the end of data collection after participants
have acquired first-hand knowledge about the study procedures. This
ensures that consent to participate is completely separate from
permission to share and the risk that asking participants about sharing
their data will affect their decision about whether or not to
participate in research. However, some Institutions may prefer to have
Authorized Investigators incorporate data sharing permission into the
research consent process or even to have data sharing permission be part
of an entirely separate protocol. The important and essential point is
to secure sharing permission and record it faithfully.</p>
<h6 id="how-to-ask">How to ask</h6>
<p>To standardize the process of obtaining data sharing releases from
participants---and make it as simple as possible for
researchers---Databrary has developed the Databrary Release Template.
The template can be added to or incorporated within human subjects
research ethics protocols. The Databrary Release Template was developed
and refined in close consultation with the IRB office at NYU. It gives
researchers a standardized way to obtain the necessary permissions to
share data in Databrary.
The template makes it clear and unambiguous to participants about what
agreeing to share data in Databrary will mean.</p>
<h4 id="uploading-to-databrary">Uploading to Databrary</h4>
<h5 id="what-to-upload">What to upload</h5>
<p>In addition to video, Databrary can store many types of data and
supplemental files associated with a research project. These can be
images, graphs, stimuli, protocols, blank questionnaires, analysis code,
and consent or release documents. Databrary permits Authorized
Investigators to store any information permitted by the Institution.
However, some information poses greater risks to participants than
others, and these should be stored on Databrary only after special
consideration. For example, first or last names, home location
information more specific than state, and contact information are
generally considered high risk for the disclosure of participants'
identities. These data items should <strong>not</strong> be uploaded to Databrary.</p>
<p>Video and audio recordings may be uploaded to Databrary if the
Authorized Investigator has secured participant (or parent) permission
and the Institution approves. Under some circumstances, an Institution
may determine that participant (or parent) permission is not necessary
to store video and audio recordings on Databrary. For example, regarding
recordings collected a long time in the past, participant (or parent)
permission may be unavailable, and the Institution may determine that
the risk to participants is low. Or, an Authorized Investigator may
choose to store video and audio recordings on Databrary for sharing only
among collaborators and Affiliates specifically chosen by the Authorized
Investigator, but have no plans to share the videos with the broader
Databrary community. This use of Databrary is permitted, but
discouraged, as the purpose of Databrary is to foster data sharing
beyond an individual research project or group.</p>
<p>Exact birth dates or test dates may also be considered identifiable data
elements. However, these dates can be highly valuable for future
research uses, and may pose a lower level of risk to participants than
some other data elements. Accordingly, Databrary permits the storage of
exact dates, but treats exact dates with special care. The system only
exposes exact dates to Authorized Investigators or their Affiliates who
upload the data, and only exposes exact dates in shared datasets if the
participant has agreed to share data (grant sharing release at the
<em>Authorized User</em> level or above).</p>
<p>Other low risk data items like race, ethnicity, gender, and related
personal characteristics may be stored on Databrary without specific
permission.</p>
<h5 id="assignment-of-sharing-release-level">Assignment of sharing release level</h5>
<p>The only essential item of information required for uploading files to
Databrary is the sharing release level. Authorized Investigators are
responsible for recording participant sharing release permissions and
assigning them to files uploaded to Databrary. Databrary assigns all
files a default release level of <em>Private</em>, so an Authorized
Investigator must change the default <em>Private</em> release setting in order
to share a file with people other than an Authorized Investigator's
Affiliates or Authorized Investigators who are research collaborators on
a specific dataset.</p>
<h5 id="who-may-upload">Who may upload</h5>
<p>Authorized Investigators may upload data, and Authorized Investigators
determine who among their Affiliates may also upload data to Databrary.</p>
<h5 id="when-to-upload">When to upload</h5>
<p>Authorized Investigators need not wait until a research project ends to
upload data to Databrary. Authorized Investigators may upload files to
Databrary as soon as possible after a data collection. This is called
active curation. It distributes the time required to curate a dataset
for sharing and thereby reduces the overall burden of data sharing.</p>
<h4 id="non-human-animal-data">Non-human animal data</h4>
<p>We are developing guidance for the use of Databrary to store non-human
animal data.</p>
<h4 id="sharing-data_1">Sharing data</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators determine when data stored on Databrary are
ready to be shared with the broader community of Databrary Authorized
Investigators. Typical 'triggers' for sharing a data collection are
when a paper goes out for review or goes to press, when a grant report
is prepared, or when a grant period ends. To share a dataset, the
Authorized Investigator simply changes the access level on that dataset.
This makes metadata about all data and materials visible so that other
Authorized Investigators can access them, subject to the sharing release
levels indicated for each file. Datasets receive a persistent identifier
(DOI) when shared. Authorized Investigators may "unshare" a dataset,
but except under unusual circumstances, this is not considered best
practice.</p>
<h4 id="removing-or-altering-participant-data">Removing or altering participant data</h4>
<p>Research participants in the European Economic Area (EEA) have certain
rights under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) pertaining to
the use, sharing, and removal of their personal data.</p>
<p>Since Databrary does not typically store information that maps personal
identities to the data stored on Databrary without a separate agreement,
Authorized Investigators and Institutions are responsible for responding
to any requests to provide copies of, change, restrict access to, or
delete a participants' personal data stored on Databrary. Databrary
cannot guarantee that personal data previously shared on Databrary can
be retrieved from all Authorized Investigators who have accessed the
data. Thus, in seeking permission from research participants to share
personal data via Databrary, Authorized Investigators should communicate
that there are limits to a participant's right to modify or delete
personal data previously shared on Databrary.</p>
<h4 id="changing-institutions">Changing institutions</h4>
<p>Authorized Investigators who change Institutions must notify Databrary
of the change and its effective date. As soon as possible, the
Authorized Investigator must secure authorization from their new
Institution. Authorized Investigators who are awaiting authorization
from their new Institution will have access to their own data but not to
non-public data shared by other Authorized Investigators on Databrary.
Once an Authorized Investigator has secured approval from the new
Institution, full access privileges will be restored.</p>
