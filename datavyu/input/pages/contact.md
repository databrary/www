# Technical & Research Support

Please use our [Support Inquiry Form](https://forms.gle/ZqdwbBLJ3GRgiX8g6). We ask you to relay your institutional affiliation and research principle investigator so we can best understand how to support your needs.

For issues related to installing Datavyu, video playback, troubleshooting, and other technical assistance: we direct your *technical support request* to our tech staff and development team. Please tell us what type of computer you are using (PC or Mac), the computerâ€™s operating system (e.g., Windows 10 or Mac OS 10.15 Catalina), the video plug-in you are using (e.g., FFMpeg or NativeOSX), and the version of Datavyu you are using (e.g., 1.3.7 or 1.5.1).

For issues related to scripting support, assessing reliability, spreadsheet design, and other aspects of coding: we will direct your *research support request* to a Datavyu super user. These are scientists who use Datavyu in their own behavioral research. Please include details on your research questions, coding workflows, and study designs to best help our super users help you.
