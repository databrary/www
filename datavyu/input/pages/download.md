# Current Status

The Datavyu coding tool is free academic software that continuously adapts and keeps up with changing OS and software updates.

There are a wide variety of video formats, settings, and codecs on the market, all of which can affect video playback. We recommend in-depth testing to ensure that Datavyu plays your specific videos properly in your work environment prior to using it for research. We also recommend that users do not upgrade computers or software in the middle of coding a study with Datavyu.

We are available to provide help and guidance for Datavyu, but we are limited in our ability to troubleshoot or provide fixes for every case due to the myriad of variables affecting video playback.

# Older Releases

Most people should use the latest stable release, but you can also download [older releases](/releases/) or [unstable versions](/releases_pre/).

# Tools

We suggest coding with an extended keyboard or a USB numpad to take advantage of Datavyu's Data Viewer Controller.
The Controller maps onto the numpad and allows users to navigate swiftly and easily through a data source.

Please feel free to use our [coding example](/user-guide/_downloads/DatavyuSample.zip) to practice coding with a sample video and corresponding spreadsheet.
See how to observe specific behaviors and mark them in Datavyu.
